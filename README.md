## üõ†Ô∏è Building and Running the Game

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-link>
   cd project-root
   ```

2. Build and run the game using `Makefile`:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

   - This compiles all the `.c` files and runs the executable.
   - The executable name is `dungeon_game`.

3. Clean up object files and the executable:
